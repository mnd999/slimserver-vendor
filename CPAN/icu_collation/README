This is a brief explanation of the Logitech Media Server's custom ICU collation
file and its creation. This file will become most useful for ICU v.60+.

At the time of this writing, the following files are in this directory:

46_small_icu_coll.txt - The legacy LMS custom ICU 4.6 .dat file contents
59_excess_icu_coll.txt - The unecessary contents within the stock ICU 59.1 .dat.
59_full_icu_coll.txt - The stock ICU 59.1 .dat file contents.
59_small_icu_coll.txt - The LMS custom ICU 59.1 .dat file contents
icudt46l.dat - The legacy LMS custom ICU 4.6 .dat file (little endian)
icudt59l.dat - The stock ICU 59.1 .dat file (little endian)
small_icudt59l.dat - The LMS custom ICU 59.1 .dat file (little endian)

The LMS custom collation only retains the collation files for the following:
cs, da, de, en, es, fi, fr, he, it, ja, nb, nl, pl, pt, ru, sv, zh

In ICU 4.6, this required two files for each language:
coll/cs.res
coll/cs_CZ.res

In addition, there were several mandated, common file contents. Following v4.8,
ICU shifted to a different numbering scheme, so the next release was v49. Each
collation file is unique to its release, and the ICU binaries and libraries search
for the .dat file based on the two digit number. This allows multiple .dat files to 
coexist in the same directory without conflict.

Starting with v53, ICU shifted to a new .dat file structure, wherein basic formatting,
display names and other localized data are separated from the collations. This meant
that for each language in iCU v53+, now three files are required:
cs.res
cs_CZ.res
coll/cs.res

As long as this structure remains in place, the "59_small_icu_coll.txt" listing can
serve as the template list of collations moving foward. The current file contents were
built by hand and through trial and error.

(ROUGH) HOWTO:
In order to build the next generation of LMS custom ICU collation, a working icupkg needs
to be on the system. This can either be built from source, or (preferred) installed from 
the OS's rpm/pkg manager. 

1. The first step is to extract the full file listing from the stock collation file. This
file is located within the icu4c-{ver}-src.tgz, at: icu/source/data/in

    icupkg -l icudt59l.dat > 59_full_icu_coll.txt

2. Now we need to make the list of files to be deleted from the stock .dat

    grep -v -x -f 59_small_icu_coll.txt 59_full_icu_coll.txt > 59_excess_icu_coll.txt

3. Next we cut out all the excess files from the stock .dat to create ours

    icupkg -r 59_excess_icu_coll.txt small_icudt59l.dat

This example uses the output filename of "small_icudt59l.dat" for process clarity. The 
ICU dat files cannot be renamed using "mv" or "cp". In order to get our custom file 
ready for prime time, these are the steps:

4. Rename the LMS custom .dat file, and relocate it at the same time

   icupkg small_icudt59l.dat ../icudt59l.dat

5. Create a big endian version

   cd ..
   icupkg -tb icudt59l.dat icudt59b.dat

Thus endeth the lesson.
